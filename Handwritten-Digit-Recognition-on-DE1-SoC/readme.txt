We ran the TrainNN file on the host computers to get the weights in the .bin format. 
We saved those on the host computer and ran the lab3 capture_image.cc to save the image in the grayscale format.
We ended with trying to scale the image to a 28x28 but had to leave because of time constraints.


Edit 05/02

Made changes to capture image for it to take pictures at 240x240 to 28x28
